# Tasmania 2018

We visited Japan in 21 March to 1 April 2017. The trip was organised by Dan Campbell of [InsideJapan Tours](https://www.insidejapantours.com/).

Dan created a fantastic itinerary for us. We started with a few days of Tokyo, then headed down south to Okayama and Hiroshima, before returning via Osaka and Kyoto.

All in all, it was a fantastic journey, and I hope the following blog pages captures some of the magic from that trip.

## ðŸš€ Project Structure

Inside this project, you'll see the following folders and files:

```

In addition, each trip will be stored as a separate repository in the
`travelens` organization. This project integrates all the individual
repositories into a single seamless website.

## ðŸ§ž Commands

All commands are run from the root of the project, from a terminal:
